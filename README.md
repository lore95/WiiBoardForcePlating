# WiiBoardForcePlating
Small project to increase the force readings acquired on a wiboard to 640Hz.

SETUP GUIDE:


Install requirements.txt, possibly on a new virtual environment as some packages such as seria and pyserial might conflict. Configure the wiiboard with the provided guide (if you dont have one ask linus for one) and run the code in the environment you set up (python wiiboardPressureReader.py)
